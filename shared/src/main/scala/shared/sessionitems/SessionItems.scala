   * you see its initialising multiple sessions however the session
   * for connections is already initialised in processlogin function.
   * Reason behind such a structure is that at this point We really don't
   * know if we require multiple sessions. Even if we do, We don't want the
   * user to wait for all the session initialisation. Its more of a background process
   * @return All session uri except for connections.
