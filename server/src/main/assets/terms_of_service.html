            </ol>

            <ol><li>In using our Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third parties, including links to web pages and services of such parties (“Third Party Content”). We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content and will have no responsibility for Third Party Content including, without limitation, material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable in your jurisdiction.

We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings and you understand that your use of Third Party Content, and your interactions with third parties, is at your own risk.
            </ol>
        <li>WALLETS
            <ol><li>The Synereo Social Alpha Product will maintain cryptocurrency wallets for test-only use on the Omni Layer and Bitcoin testnet network. You hereby agree The Alpha Product is not to be modified or configured to run on the Bitcoin livenet network.
                <li>There is no promise of value of Testnet Tokens. The tokens associated with your account and the bitcoin address created for it, as well as your your access to them may be lost during or after the Alpha period due to software defects, software updates, Public Node Operator actions, and/or Bitcoin testnet network issues. Software issues due to source code or operations by Node Operators might lead to partial or total loss of wallet data and thus access to Omni Layer and Bitcoin testnet tokens.
                <li>No Private Key access. In order to discourage use of wallets during the Alpha Release period outside of the Alpha Product itself, the product won't provide users direct access to their wallet private key(s).
                <li>The Services will maintain the private keys and attempt to keep them secret, even from you. The private keys might become visible or decryptable by Node Operators including Public Node Operators. It is Synereo's intent to significantly strengthen privacy and security features in subsequent product releases.
                <li>There is no inherent or promised value in Testnet Tokens beyond their purpose for testing user interactions.
            </ol>
        <li>THE SYNEREO SERVICES
            <ol><li>E-mail Registration. You must provide an email address during registration.
                <li>No Password Retrieval. The software might not provide a mechanism to recover your password and thus the data you have created, sent, or received.
                <li>Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Omni Layer and Bitcoin transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Bitcoin public ledger via the Bitcoin distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer payment network that operates on a cryptographic protocol), which is not owned, controlled or operated by Synereo. The Bitcoin Network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties.
                <li>Synereo has no control over the Bitcoin network or Omni Layer software, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Bitcoin network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Bitcoin network. You may use the Services to submit these details to the network.
                <li>No Storage or Transmission of Testnet Tokens (AMPs or bitcoins). AMPs and bitcoins are an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Bitcoin network. The Services do not store, send or receive bitcoins. Any transfer of title that might occur in any bitcoins occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Bitcoin network and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can effect the transfer of title or right in any bitcoins.
                <li>Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship, you and Synereo being with respect to one another independent contractors.
                <li>Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide to Synero via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Synereo is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Omni Layer or bitcoin transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype a Wallet Address or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
                <li>No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Bitcoin network via the Services, The Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Synereo has no control over the Bitcoin Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.
                <li>Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Synereo is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Bitcoin transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Bitcoin transactions.
            </ol>
        <li>FEES FOR USING THE SYNEREO SERVICES
            <ol><li>Use of Synereo Social Alpha Product is free. Synereo does not currently charge fees for any Services; however, we reserve the right to do so in future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies.
            </ol>
        <li>DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICES
            <ol><li>We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You may lose access to your Wallet during this time.
